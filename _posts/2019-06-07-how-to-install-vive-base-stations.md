Before installing the base stations, you need the following materials which you can find them in the HTC Vive Pro package.  
* 2 base stations
* 2 base station power adapters
* 2 mounting brackets

## The play area
Think and decide about your play area. 
  * Room-scale: you can move within an area.
    * Min. 2m * 1.5 m^2 $$ E = mc^2 $$
    * Max. 6m * 6m
    The base stations should be installed on top of your head for acurate tracking.
  * Standing/Seated: you should only stand or sit down and play the game.
    *  no minimum size requirement.
