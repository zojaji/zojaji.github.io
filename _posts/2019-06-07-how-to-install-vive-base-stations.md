Before installing the base stations, you need the following materials which you can find them in the HTC Vive Pro package.  
* 2 base stations
* 2 base station power adapters
* 2 mounting brackets

## The play area
Think and decide about your play area. 
  * Room-scale: you can move within an area.
    * Minimum area: 2 m * 1.5 m
    * Maximum area: 6 m * 6 m    
    * The base stations should be mounted at least 2 meters above your head in two opposite corners with an angle of 30 to 45 degrees down, for accurately tracking your play area. They should be placed no furthur than 5 meters apart.
    * Move all furnitures and other obstacles out of your play area.
  * Standing/Seated: you should only stand or sit down and play the game.
    *  no minimum size requirement.   

## The status light
The status light of the base station shows:
  * White or green: normal mode.
  * Blue or blinking blue: waiting to stabilize (if it remains in this state, check if it is mounted securely or on a surface that's not prone to vibration).
  * Blinking red: error.
